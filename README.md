# Wordle: Multi‑Player / Single-Player Edtion

> **Group 14 • Python • Pygame • 2025**

This project is a local party / single version of the classic *Wordle* game. Up to **6 players** take turns guessing the **same hidden five‑letter word**, compete for points, and enjoy a lively scoreboard—all wrapped in a colorful GUI built with **Pygame**.
